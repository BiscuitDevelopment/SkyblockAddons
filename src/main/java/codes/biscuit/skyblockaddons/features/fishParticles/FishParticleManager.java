/**
 *
 * This class allows us to approximate the trail of fish particles made by a fish converging to the player's bobber.
 * To do this, we use a variant on the Bellman Ford algorithm, as well as the exponentiation-by-squaring algorithm
 *
 * In general, we wish to identify those splash particles that belong to a fish converging on the player's bobber.
 * Notice several identifying features of these converging particles:
 *     1) Particles spawn at a radial distance from the cast hook.
 *         - That distance decreases by .1 blocks for sequential particles (with a small amount of variation)
 *         - During the rain, or in the case of dropped packets, the distance can be .2 blocks.
 *     2) Particles spawn at an angle (think polar coordinates) to the cast hook.
 *         - That angle differs based on a gaussian distribution for sequential particles
 *         - The gaussian distribution has mean 0 and standard deviation 4 degrees
 *         - Based on the distribution, very few sequential particles (<.27%) will differ in angle by more than
 *             3 standard distributions (12 degrees)
 *     3) Sequential particles approaching the hook generally come in every tick, but we can allow for 2 or 3 ticks
 *     4) Particles will not spawn farther than 8 blocks away from the cast hook
 *
 *     (These are mostly discoverable in the EntityFishHook.java file. Hopefully, my making this algorithm won't cause servers to go ballistic...)
 *
 * Consideration of time complexity is a huge part of the algorithm.
 * It is an O(n^2) algorithm, which for a large number of particles is unsustainable.
 * Each tick only gives us 50 milliseconds to compute stuff, so we're using bitwise operations.
 * Unfortunately, the longest primitive is 64 bits, so we're limited to tracking 64 particles at the moment.
 * This means when 10+ fishers are in the same spot, we may not be able to link the particles before we overwrite with new ones.
 *
 * Processing the per-particle step takes <.025 milliseconds and the per-tick step generally takes <.050 milliseconds
 * So we are well below any critical thresholds for computation time.
