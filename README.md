For Contributors

1. Make sure to add this VM argument to your debug configuration or your IDE's equivalent, so all the transformers
are applied properly in your dev environment!
```-Dfml.coreMods.load=codes.biscuit.skyblockaddons.tweaker.SkyblockAddonsLoadingPlugin```
2. Set the Gradle task ```processResourcesDev``` to run every time before launching the Minecraft client from
 your dev environment. This is required for the mod assets to load properly in the dev environment.
3. This project uses Lombok, which helps with things such as not having to manually create Getters and 
Setters. If you are using IntelliJ, please download the plugin called Lombok either in your IDE or by 
[visiting this link](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok) so that everything works correctly. 
If you are using Eclipse, [you can read this page here.](https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse)
4. After installing the plugin in IntelliJ, go to `File` → `Settings` → `Build` → 
`Execution, Deployment, Compiler` → `Annotation Processors`, and check ☑ 
`Enable annotation processing` on the top right. This will allow you to debug properly.

Note: If your jar build is failing because the code is trying to access private methods or fields,
this way be because someone added some access transformers. 
You may want to re-run the gradle tasks `setupDecompWorkspace` and `setupDevWorkspace` so 
the access transformers are applied to the source code!
