Contributor's Guide
------

Please make sure to make your pull requests off the `main` branch if you're adding new features. 
If there's an important bug fix, always make a PR, but off of the `stable` branch. Then that hotfix
can be rebased back into `main` afterwards (with `checkout main`, & `rebase stable`).
```shell script
# Not recommended
git checkout -b development --track origin/development
```

### Requirements
- **IDE** (One of them)
  - [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) **(Recommended)**
    - Our team uses IDEA. We may not be able to provide support for other IDEs.
  - [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)
- **(Plugin) Lombok** to help with things such as not having to manually create Getters and Setters.
  - IntelliJ IDEA (pre-installed)
  - [Eclipse](https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse)

### Getting started
**Note:** You can use `gradle` instead of using gradle wrapper `./gradlew`.

1. Clone the repository
2. Wait for the gradle project to import.
3. Setup the development environment
    ```shell script
    ./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
    ```
4. Integrate the development environment with your IDE
    - IntelliJ IDEA
      - Done automatically
    - Eclipse **(doesn't generate debug configuration)**
    ```shell script
    ./gradlew eclipse
    ```
    - Change **Text File Encoding** from `Default` to `UTF-8`
      - Go to `Window` -> `Preferences` -> `General` -> `Workspace`
      - Change `Text File Encoding` from `Default` to `UTF-8`
5. **You are now ready to build the mod!**

### How to build
1. Build the mod
    ```shell script
    ./gradlew build
    ```
    > **Note**
    > 
    > If your jar **build** is **failing** because the code is trying to access private methods or fields,
    > this may be because someone added some new access transformers.
    >
    > You may want to re-run the gradle task
    > ```shell script
    > ./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
    > ```
    > so the access transformers are applied to the source code!
    > 
2. (Optional) Run the **Minecraft Forge** client
    - Using IntelliJ IDEA
        - Add the environment variable `FETCH_DATA_ONLINE=true` if you want to use data files from the CDN.
        - Run the "Minecraft Client" debug configuration.
        - Click the link in the console to log in with [DevAuth](https://github.com/DJtheRedstoner/DevAuth).
    - Using the command line
    ```shell script
    ./gradlew runClient --args="--username <username> --password <password>"
    ```
